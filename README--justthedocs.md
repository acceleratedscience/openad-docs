# OpenAD Documentation

This repo holds the documentation for the OpenAD documentation. It runs on (Just the Docs)[https://just-the-docs.com/], which is a responsive Jekyll theme.

The documentation currently lives on a temporary URL:
[https://themoenen.github.io/openad-docs]

## Previewing the Site Locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.
